## 📋 Prerequisites

- Databricks Workspace with system table access
- Python 3.8+
- Databricks CLI configured
- OpenAI API key (for DSPy)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/databricks-insight-agent.git
cd databricks-insight-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Databricks and OpenAI credentials
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Set up Databricks connection:
```python
from src.agents.data_ingestion import DataIngestionAgent

agent = DataIngestionAgent()
agent.connect_databricks()
```

2. Run the orchestrator:
```python
from src.agents.orchestrator import OrchestratorAgent

orchestrator = OrchestratorAgent()
orchestrator.run_analysis()
```

## 📊 Use Cases

- **Network Monitoring**: Detect connectivity issues, bandwidth anomalies, and traffic patterns
- **Security Analysis**: Identify unauthorized access, data exfiltration attempts, and compliance violations
- **Operational Insights**: Monitor cluster performance, job failures, and resource utilization
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate executive summaries and alert notifications

## 🔧 Configuration

See [config/](config/) for detailed configuration options including:
- Agent parameters
- DSPy optimization settings
- MLflow experiment configurations
- Databricks connection settings

## 📈 Evaluation & Scoring
